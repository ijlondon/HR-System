HR-System
===============
University's Human Resources Backend

How to start the server:
* cd to backend/HR-System
* run `mvn install`
* run `java -jar target/HR-System-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --settings.cors_origin=http://localhost:3000`

Should probably have other content in this section too

A big thank you to:
